MLB Baseball Performance Dashboard

A comprehensive Power BI analytics project exploring MLB batting, fielding, and team-level performance from 2015 to 2024.

📌 Project Overview

This project delivers an interactive MLB Performance Dashboard built in Power BI, designed to help users evaluate hitter efficiency, power output, fielding reliability, team KPIs, and long-term trends.

The dashboard is ideal for:

Analysts looking for actionable insights

Coaches reviewing player performance

Fans interested in advanced baseball metrics

Students building sports analytics portfolios

🎯 Project Objective

The primary objective is to transform raw MLB hitting and fielding data into a clear, interactive analytical tool that highlights:

Player power vs. efficiency

Team defensive consistency

Year-to-year offensive and defensive trends

KPI performance against targets

Position-based strengths and weaknesses

This dashboard supports informed decision-making by revealing hidden patterns and performance gaps across the league.

⚙️ Process
1. Data Collection & Cleaning

Integrated multiple seasons (2015–2024) of batting and fielding datasets.

Cleaned data in Power Query (null removal, standardized team names, data type corrections).

Created calculated stats such as AVG, OBP, SLG, Barrel Rate, Rdrs/yr, Defensive Efficiency, etc.

2. Data Modeling

Built a relationship model connecting:

Player tables

Team statistics

Seasonal metrics

Engineered new measures using DAX for:

KPI scoring

Mendoza Line benchmarks

OBP targets

Error reductions

Player efficiency ratios

3. Dashboard Development

Designed a multi-page interactive Power BI experience:

Scatterplots

Gauges

Trend charts

Treemaps

Stacked bars

Player directories

Applied slicers for:
Year, Position, Team, AB, PA, and more.

🔹 Player Comparison (AVG vs Mendoza Line)

🔹 Team Fielding Overview

🔹 Team Efficiency – Errors by Position

🔹 Batting Trends Over Time

🔹 Team-Oriented Performance (Astros Example)

🔹 Team KPIs vs Goals

📊 Project Insights

Power hitters display high HR output but show wide variance in barrel rate across seasons.

Efficiency hitters show strong correlation between AVG and OBP, confirming consistency over volume.

Fielding analysis reveals clear gaps in defensive performance, especially at infield positions such as SS and 3B.

Team trends show fluctuations in batting metrics year over year, with league-wide OBP and SLG increasing post-2019.

The Astros’ KPI dashboard (2024) highlights where offensive targets fell short and where defensive goals exceeded expectations.

Errors cluster heavily by position, helping teams pinpoint where defensive improvement is needed.

🏁 Final Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard provides a complete analytical view of MLB performance by combining advanced metrics, visual storytelling, and interactive features. The tool makes it easy to:

Compare players

Evaluate team defense

Monitor KPIs

Identify year-over-year trends

Highlight strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities

It serves as a robust foundation for baseball analytics portfolios, coaching insights, and data-driven sports decision-making.
